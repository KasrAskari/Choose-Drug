# 💊 Choose-Drug  

## Overview  
The **Choose-Drug** project leverages machine learning to recommend the most suitable medication for patients based on their characteristics. Using a **Decision Tree Classifier**, the model predicts the best drug by analyzing key patient features such as age, gender, and symptoms.  

## Features  
✅ **Smart Drug Recommendation** – Predicts the best medication based on patient data.  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Utilizes a **Decision Tree Classifier** for accurate predictions.  
✅ **Data-Driven Insights** – Based on the `drug200` dataset, containing real-world pharmaceutical data.
