# Choose-Drug  

## Overview  
This project focuses on helping to choose the right drug for a patient using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. It predicts the most suitable medication based on patient data. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about various drugs and their uses.

## Features  
- **Drug Recommendation:** Predicts the most suitable medication for patients based on features like age, gender, and symptoms.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements a decision tree classifier for accurate predictions.  
- **Dataset:** Uses the `drug200` dataset for training the model.
